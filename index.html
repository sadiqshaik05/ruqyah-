            <h2>What is Counselling?</h2>
            <p>"Counselling is a process where a trained professional (a counselor) helps individuals, couples, or families explore and address their emotional, mental, or behavioral issues. It involves a confidential and trusting relationship where clients can discuss their concerns and work towards positive change. Essentially, it's a form of talking therapy designed to promote personal growth and well-being. <br>

            Key Aspects of Counselling: <br>
                1) Relationship: <br>
                    => Counselling is built on a strong, trusting relationship between the counselor and the client. <br> 
                2) Confidentiality: <br>
                    => Counsellors maintain strict confidentiality to create a safe space for open communication.<br>
                3) Exploration: <br>
                    => Clients explore their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, often with the guidance of the counselor. <br>
                4) Problem-solving: <br>
                    => Counselors help clients identify and address challenges, develop coping mechanisms, and make positive changes. <br>
                5) Personal Growth: <br>
                    => Counselling aims to empower individuals to develop self-awareness, emotional resilience, and a greater sense of well-being. <br>
                6) Variety of Approaches: <br>
                    => Counselling can be tailored to address different needs, including individual, couples, family, and group counseling, as well as career counseling. <br>
                    => In essence, counselling is a collaborative process that supports individuals in navigating life's challenges and fostering personal growth and positive change.</p>

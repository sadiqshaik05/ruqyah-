              <h2>📖 WHAT IS RUQYAH SHARIAH?</h2>
              <img id="q" src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th/id/OIP.1l_RZpy_3C7_u6gcOShZHwHaEK?pid=Api&P=0&h=180" alt="" width="300" height="300">
              <p>
                Ruqyah Shariah is a spiritual healing method in Islam that involves reciting verses from the Qur’an, duas (supplications), and authentic prophetic traditions (Hadith) to cure physical illnesses, emotional distress, spiritual ailments, sihr (black magic), ayn (evil eye), and possession by jinn.

                It is a halal and prescribed remedy for all believers facing unseen or unexplained afflictions. Ruqyah is not superstition—it is rooted in divine revelation and prophetic practice.
                
                We strive to create a safe, halal, and trustworthy environment for those seeking relief through the words of Allah ﷻ.
